# shipwreck_survival_predictor

Use cross validation and a hyperparameter grid search to optimize a machine learning pipeline.

Use the Titanic Survival Dataset to build a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on attributes of each passenger in the data set.

Start with building a Random Forest Classifier, then modify the pipeline to use a Logistic Regression estimator instead. Then evaluate and compare your results.
